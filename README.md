Celestial Bodies Database
Overview
The Celestial Bodies Database is a relational database designed to store and manage information about various celestial objects, including stars, planets, moons, asteroids, comets, galaxies, and constellations. This database is intended for use in astronomical research, education, and cataloging purposes.

Note: This project is a FreeCodeCamp assignment, which means it is part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum designed to help learners practice their skills in database design and SQL.

Features
Store details about stars, planets, moons, asteroids, comets, galaxies, and constellations.
Define relationships between celestial objects (e.g., planets orbiting stars, moons orbiting planets).
Run SQL queries to retrieve and analyze data.
Use various SQL tools and command-line interfaces to interact with the database.

Schema Overview
Stars: Information about stars, including mass, radius, and temperature.
Planets: Information about planets, including mass, radius, and orbital details.
Moons: Information about moons, including mass, radius, and orbital details.
Asteroids: Information about asteroids, including mass, radius, and orbital details.
Comets: Information about comets, including nucleus mass, radius, and orbital details.
Galaxies: Information about galaxies, including type and number of stars.
Constellations: Information about constellations, including major stars and viewing times.
